# Quick Start Guide

At the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to use DataHub Cloud to turn datasets and data-driven content on GitHub into a published, shareable site.

> Note: While our tutorial focuses on publishing a dataset, with a few tweaks, you can turn this into an engaging data story.

## Start out from our template 

- Go to [Datahub Cloud Template](https://github.com/new?template_name=datahub-cloud-template&template_owner=datahubio)
- Give your new repository a name
- You can make it either public or private - it works with both
- Create the repository
- Done! This is what it should look like:

- Now that you've got your own copy, it's time to publish it with Datahub Cloud

## Sign up 

If you have your invite link head over and sign up.

If you don't yet have an invite, please [sign up for early access here](https://tally.so/r/wad1O2) - we're onboarding people as quickly as possible.

## Publish your dataset

- Click on "Create New Site" and follow the steps
> Note: Make sure to choose the GitHub repository you just created.
- This was quite quick, right?
- Now, hit "Visit" and let's see what it looks like:

You are ready to roll! 

Now you can either enhance this dataset or try publishing your own dataset (continue reading).

> Note: For the time being, you're going to have to click on the "Sync" button on Datahub Cloud after every change made in your repository (we are currently working on removing this step).

## Enhancing your dataset

Start populating your new repository with data. Enhance your content with other data visualisation components and markdown features. Update your README using Markdown to provide insights into your dataset. Let your data tell its story!
